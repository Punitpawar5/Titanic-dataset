When i first watched titanic🚢,I was so indulged by the beauty and the size of the ship and the romantic storyline😍 but at the same time felt a sense of trauma from the tragic accident😰.What a fabulous movie😌 

So few days back i give it a rewatch🫣, but this time the data scientist inside me saw the movie with different perspective and used my analytical ability📊 to analyse the story and then use the Titanic dataset for my data science project🫢 and performed eda, and also fetched many insightful information and got answers to many questions like

• What is the overall survival rate of passengers on the Titanic?
• What is the gender distribution of survivors?
• How does the survival rate vary based on passenger class?
• What is the age distribution of survivors?
• How does the number of siblings/spouses aboard affect the survival rate?
• How does the number of parents/children aboard affect the survival rate?
• What is the fare distribution among passengers?
• How does the port of embarkation affect the survival rate?
• What is the total number of passengers and the number of survivors?
• What is the total number of deaths?
